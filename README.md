# predicting-the-motion-detection-from-the-data-collected-by-the-IoT-sensors

 The main objective of this project was to create a deep learning model, specifically a CNN, that could accurately detect room occupancy based on environmental sensor data. The sensor data used included temperature, humidity, and Co2, which were collected by an IoT system consisting of three sensors placed in different locations with varying environmental conditions.

The data collected was stored in a file and used to train the CNN model to predict the "motion" feature, which indicates the presence of movement in proximity to the sensors. Keras, a popular deep learning framework, was used to implement and optimize the model's hyperparameters.

Once the model was developed and optimized, its performance was evaluated by analyzing various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The results were presented in a technical report, which included diagrams, plots, tables, and numerical data to help visualize and interpret the model's performance.

Overall, this project demonstrated the potential of using CNN models and environmental sensor data to detect room occupancy, which could have practical applications in areas such as building automation, energy management, and security systems.
